/*The Element.getElementsByTagName() method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name. All descendants of the 
specified element are searched, but not the element itself. The returned list is live, which means it updates itself with the DOM 
tree automatically. Therefore, there is no need to call Element.getElementsByTagName() with the same element and arguments repeatedly
if the DOM changes in between calls.

When called on an HTML element in an HTML document, getElementsByTagName lower-cases the argument before searching for it. 
This is undesirable when trying to match camel-cased SVG elements (such as <linearGradient>) in an HTML document. 
Instead, use Element.getElementsByTagNameNS(), which preserves the capitalization of the tag name.

Element.getElementsByTagName is similar to Document.getElementsByTagName(), except that it only searches for elements that are 
descendants of the specified element.*/

elements = element.getElementsByTagName(tagName)

/*elements is a live HTMLCollection of elements with a matching tag name, in the order they appear. 
If no elements are found, the HTMLCollection is empty.
element is the element from where the search starts. Only the element's descendants are included, not the element itself.
tagName is the qualified name to look for. The special string "*" represents all elements.
 For compatibility with XHTML, lower-case should be used.*/
